# Introduction 
 This project focuses on ensuring the security and resilience of sensitive financial data and the institution's IT infrastructure.  The project will involve performing a risk assessment to identify potential threats that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial data.

# Problem Statement
Call centers handle sensitive customer and business information, making them targets for security threats such as unauthorised access, data breaches and system failures. Currently, there is no comprehensive framework in place to safeguard data and ensure secure operations. This exposes the organisation to risks including data loss, reputational damage, operational downtime and regulatory non-compliance. Emerging threats, remote work setups and third-party integrations further increase the center’s vulnerability. A structured risk assessment is needed to identify, analyse and prioritise these risks effectively. The findings will guide the implementation of strong security protocols to protect customer data, ensure compliance and maintain business continuity.

# Objectives
The goal of this project is to perform a risk assessment to identify potential threats that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of financial data

# Methodology 
Follow Risk management principles to ensure appropriate steps are taken to mitigate these risks.

## Tasks

1. **Conduct a Risk Assessment**
- Identify potential risks that could affect the financial institution, such as unauthorised access to customer records, denial-of-service attacks, fraud or violations of data privacy laws.
- Analyse identified risks by assessing their likelihood and potential impact on financial data security, customer trust and business operations.
- Evaluate and prioritise the risks, focusing on those that could have the most severe consequences for financial data protection and regulatory compliance.

2. **Prepare a Risk Treatment Plan Request**
- Based on the assessment, prepare a formal request for a risk treatment plan to be submitted to the relevant departments (e.g., IT, Compliance, Operations).
- Include clear recommendations for addressing the identified risks, such as improving encryption, upgrading cybersecurity defenses, enhancing fraud detection systems conducting staff training on financial data security.

3. **Prepare Risk Assessment Report**
- Create a detailed report that documents the risks identified during the assessment, including their likelihood and potential impact on the financial institution.
- Create a formal request outlining the recommended actions to mitigate the identified risks, directed to the appropriate departments for implementation.
