# Introduction 
 This project focuses on ensuring the security and resilience of sensitive financial data and the institution's IT infrastructure. It will involve performing a risk assessment to identify potential threats that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial data.

# Problem Statement
The client faces growing cybersecurity threats and regulatory challenges that endanger the confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive financial data. Increasing digital reliance has exposed vulnerabilities such as data breaches, fraud, system downtime and compliance risks. 

Currently, there is no comprehensive risk assessment to identify and prioritise these threats effectively. This limits the organisation’s ability to implement appropriate mitigation strategies and maintain regulatory compliance. Therefore, a structured risk assessment following ISO 27001 principles is needed to evaluate risks and develop targeted treatment plans to strengthen data security and resilience.

# Objectives
The goal of the project is to perform a risk assessment for the client to identify potential threats that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of financial data

---

# Methodology 
Follow Risk management principles to ensure appropriate steps are taken to mitigate these risks.

## Tasks

1. **Conduct a Risk Assessment**
- Identify potential risks that could affect the financial institution, such as unauthorised access to customer records, denial-of-service attacks, fraud or violations of data privacy laws.
- Analyse identified risks by assessing their likelihood and potential impact on financial data security, customer trust and business operations.
- Evaluate and prioritise the risks, focusing on those that could have the most severe consequences for financial data protection and regulatory compliance.

2. **Prepare a Risk Treatment Plan Request**
- Based on the assessment, prepare a formal request for a risk treatment plan to be submitted to the relevant departments (e.g., IT, Compliance, Operations).
- Include clear recommendations for addressing the identified risks, such as improving encryption, upgrading cybersecurity defenses, enhancing fraud detection systems conducting staff training on financial data security.

3. **Prepare Risk Assessment Report**
- Create a detailed report that documents the risks identified during the assessment, including their likelihood and potential impact on the financial institution.
- Create a formal request outlining the recommended actions to mitigate the identified risks, directed to the appropriate departments for implementation.
